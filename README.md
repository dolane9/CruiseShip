CruiseShip
==========

Experimenting with some Shortest Path algorithms.
-------------------------------------------------

This project is for learning purposes.
--------------------------------------

CruiseShip is a small project designed to tackle some Shortest Path
problems using known solutions and algorithms and experimenting with
some new ideas. If you like the project feel free to comment with
any suggests or ideas you have. You can also clone a copy and create
something yourself using this project as a starter.

Originally, CruiseShip was designed to solve a problem from a
programming contest called Irish Collegiate Programming Contest (IrlCPC)
which is run in University College Cork (UCC). The CruiseShip problem
is from the 2012 contest, question 3. A copy of the questions for
this contest can be found at: http://acm.ucc.ie/sites/default/files/ProblemSet2012.pdf
